- Budget impact assessment

## Phase 3: SCHEDULED (Mar 2, 2026)

**Automated cron job**: Will review Phase 1 & 2 results and decide

### Experimental Platforms (Conditional)
Only implement if gaps exist in current coverage:

1. **Indie Hackers** - High potential, founders discussing real problems
2. **Quora** - Medium potential, professional Q&A
3. **Product Hunt** - High potential, launch comments = feature requests
4. **LinkedIn Groups** - Medium-high potential, B2B pain points

### Decision Criteria
- Are current sources providing enough high-quality leads?
- Any obvious coverage gaps?
- Is volume sustainable?
- Budget available for new platforms?

## Success Metrics

Weekly reviews track:
- Total opportunities collected
- Average score
- High-quality count (60+ score)
- Top-tier count (80+ score)
- Source performance (avg score per source)
- LLM enhancement effectiveness
- Budget consumption

## Budget Status
- **Target**: <$15/month
- **Current**: $0.0005/week (~$0.002/month)
- **Headroom**: Massive - can scale 100x+ and stay under budget

## Timeline
- **Week 1 (Feb 16)**: Phase 1 live, collecting broad data
- **Week 2 (Feb 23)**: Phase 2 implementation + first weekly review
- **Week 3 (Mar 2)**: Phase 3 decision based on 2-week trends
- **Week 4+**: Continuous optimization based on weekly insights

## Philosophy
> "Start broad, refine based on data. Better to filter out noise than miss signal."

Alexey's approach: Cast a wide net, let the weekly reviews tell us what to keep.
