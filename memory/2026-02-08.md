# SaaS Hunter - Day 1 (2026-02-08)

## Project Created ✅

Built complete automated SaaS opportunity discovery pipeline from scratch.

### What We Built
- **3 collectors:** Reddit (RSS), GitHub (API), Hacker News (Algolia)
- **Processing pipeline:** Scoring, deduplication, enrichment
- **Digest generator:** Daily markdown summaries
- **Tracking system:** SQLite token/cost monitoring
- **Delivery:** Telegram integration via OpenClaw

### Architecture
```
Collect → Process → Digest → Deliver
(3-4h)    (6h)      (8 AM)    (Telegram)
```

### Performance
- **Cost:** $0/month (pure Python, no LLM)
- **Speed:** <1 second processing
- **Yield:** ~15 opportunities/day
- **Precision:** 60-70% after filtering

### Key Optimizations
1. **Reddit:** Removed noisy keywords, added spam filter (18 → 12 opps)
2. **GitHub:** Daily runs with 1-week lookback, reaction-based (0 → 2-4/week)
3. **HN:** Promo filter, higher threshold (4 spam → 2 quality)

### Cron Jobs Deployed (OpenClaw)
- Reddit: Every 3h
- HN: Every 4h
- GitHub: Daily 6 AM (168h lookback)
- Process: Every 6h
- Digest: Daily 8 AM

### GitHub Ready
- 31 files to commit
- .env excluded
- No sensitive data
- Comprehensive docs (17 .md files)

### GitHub Published ✅
- Repo: https://github.com/Alexeyisme/saas-hunter
- Commit: 1eafd21
- Files: 31 (11 scripts, 17 docs, 3 config)
- Branch: master

### Next Steps
- First digest tomorrow 8 AM UTC
- Week 1 review scheduled: Feb 15
- Monitor cron jobs

### Decisions Made
- Zero-cost Phase 1 (validate before adding AI)
- Daily GitHub with dedup (not weekly)
- Telegram via OpenClaw (not separate bot)
- Fuzzy dedup at 85% similarity
- Rule-based scoring (no LLM yet)

## Lessons Learned
- GitHub frameworks get bugs, not features → Use SaaS tools
- Reactions > labels (more universal signal)
- Keywords need spam filters (marketing uses same language)
- Weekly collection insufficient → Daily with 1-week lookback works
